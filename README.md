This is a tiny prototype to demo some changes I'm proposing to the [Home Office Design System](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/)'s  [Status Message component](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/components?name=Status%20message).

It's based on the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/), using the [Home Office plugin](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/get-started/home-office-plugin).
